Project Title: AI-Enhanced Basic Arithmetic Calculator in Python

Project Description:

This project involves the development of a simple yet functional calculator using Python, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each arithmetic operation is encapsulated in its own function — add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), and divide(a, b) — promoting modular and readable code design.

The calculator will take user input to select the desired operation and input values. While the core functionality is traditional, the project is enhanced by integrating AI-based input validation and intelligent user guidance (optional). For example, AI can help interpret natural language input (e.g., "What is 15 divided by 3?") or provide suggestions for correcting input errors, making the calculator more user-friendly and interactive.

Key Features:

Modular function-based architecture

Real-time user input and error handling

Optional AI enhancements for natural language understanding

Educational focus on Python fundamentals and basic AI integration

Objectives:

Strengthen understanding of functions and user input handling in Python

Explore the basics of integrating AI or smart features into a standard application

Develop a user-friendly interface for performing basic calculations

This project serves as an ideal starting point for those new to Python and AI, laying a strong foundation for more complex intelligent systems in the future.
